    Jessica, wake up<br />
    Jessica, wake up<br />
    <br />
    It's February again; we must get older, so wake up<br />
    <br />
    I can't write a song for you<br />
    I'm out of melodies<br />
    I can't write a song for you<br />
    But I am asking please<br />
    Jessica, wake up<br />
    Jessica, wake up<br />
    It's February again<br />
    It's February again; we must get older now, so please wake up<br />
    We must get older now, so please wake up
