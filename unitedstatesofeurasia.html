    You and me are the same<br />
    We don&#8217;t know or care who&#8217;s to blame<br />
    But we know that whoever holds the reigns<br />
    Nothing will change<br />
    Our cause has gone insane<br />
    <br />
    And these wars they can&#8217;t be won<br />
    And these wars they can&#8217;t be won<br />
    And do you want them to go on and on and on?<br />
    Why split these states<br />
    When there can be only one<br />
    <br />
    And must we do as we&#8217;re told?<br />
    Must we do as we&#8217;re told?<br />
    <br />
    You and me fall in line<br />
    To be punished for unproven crimes<br />
    And we know that there&#8217;s no one we can trust<br />
    Our ancient heroes<br />
    They are turning to dust<br />
    <br />
    And these wars they can&#8217;t be won<br />
    Does anyone know or care how they begun?<br />
    They just promise to go on and on and on<br />
    But soon we will see<br />
    There can be only one<br />
    <br />
    United States<br />
    United States of<br />
    Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!<br />
    Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!<br />
    Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!
