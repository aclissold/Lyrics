  When I was young I knew everything<br />
  She a punk who rarely ever took advice<br />
  Now I&#8217;m guilt-stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor<br />
  Stop a baby&#8217;s breath and a shoe full of rice, no<br />
  <br />
  I can&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  &#8216;Cause she was touching her face<br />
  I won&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  She fell in love in the first place<br />
  <br />
  For the life of me I cannot remember<br />
  What made us think that we were wise and we&#8217;d never compromise<br />
  For the life of me I cannot believe we&#8217;d ever die for these sins<br />
  We were merely freshmen<br />
  <br />
  My best friend took a week&#8217;s vacation to forget her<br />
  His girl took a week&#8217;s worth of valium and slept<br />
  Now he&#8217;s guilt-stricken sobbing with his head on the floor<br />
  Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he said<br />
  <br />
  I can&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  &#8216;Cause she was touching her face<br />
  I won&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  She fell in love in the first place<br />
  <br />
  For the life of me I cannot remember<br />
  What made us think that we were wise and we&#8217;d never compromise<br />
  For the life of me I cannot believe we&#8217;d ever die for these sins<br />
  We were merely freshmen<br />
  <br />
  We&#8217;ve tried to wash our hands of all of this<br />
  We never talk of our lacking relationships<br />
  And how we&#8217;re guilt-stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor<br />
  We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we&#8217;d say<br />
  <br />
  I can&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  &#8216;Cause she was touching her face<br />
  I won&#8217;t be held responsible<br />
  She fell in love in the first place<br />
  <br />
  For the life of me I cannot remember<br />
  What made us think that we were wise and we&#8217;d never compromise<br />
  For the life of me I cannot believe we&#8217;d ever die for these sins<br />
  We were merely freshmen<br />
  <br />
