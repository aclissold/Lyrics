    Well, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away
    <br />
    Yeah, maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
    <br />
    Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad person
    <br />
    Well, baby, I know
    <br />
    <br />
    And these fingertips
    <br />
    Will never run through your skin
    <br />
    And those bright blue eyes
    <br />
    Can only meet mine across a room
    <br />
    Filled with people that are less important than you
    <br />
    <br />
    Ah 'cause you love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love you
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    So I think it's best we both forget
    <br />
    Before we dwell on it
    <br />
    <br />
    The way you held me so tight
    <br />
    All through the night
    <br />
    'Til it was near morning
    <br />
    <br />
    'Cause you love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love you
    <br />
    <br />
    Ah 'cause you love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love
    <br />
    You love, love, love
    <br />
    When you know I can't love you
