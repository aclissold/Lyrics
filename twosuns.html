<!-- start of lyrics -->
in my rear view mirror the sun is going down<br />
sinking behind bridges in the road<br />
and i think of all the good things<br />
that we have left undone<br />
and i suffer premonitions<br />
confirm suspicions<br />
of the holocaust to come<br />
the rusty wire that holds the cork<br />
that keeps the anger in<br />
gives way<br />
and suddenly it's day again<br />
the sun is in the east<br />
even though the day is done<br />
two suns in the sunset<br />
hmmmmmmmmm<br />
could be the human race is run<br />
like the moment when your brakes lock<br />
and you slide toward the big truck<br />
and stretch the frozen moments with your fear<br />
and you'll never hear their voices<br />
and you'll never see their faces<br />
you have no recourse to the law anymore<br />
and as the windshield melts<br />
my tears evaporate<br />
leaving only charcoal to defend<br />
finally i understand<br />
the feelings of the few<br />
ashes and diamonds<br />
foe and friend<br />
we were all equal in the end
<!-- end of lyrics -->
