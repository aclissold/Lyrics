  Flock of birds<br />
  Hovering above<br />
  Just a flock of birds<br />
  That's how you think of love<br />
  <br />
  And I always<br />
  Look up to the sky<br />
  Pray before the dawn<br />
  Cause they fly always<br />
  Sometimes they arrive<br />
  Sometimes they are gone<br />
  Fly on<br />
  <br />
  Flock of birds<br />
  Hovering above<br />
  Into smoke I'm turned and rise,<br />
  Following them up<br />
  <br />
  Still I always<br />
  Look up to the sky<br />
  Pray before the dawn<br />
  Cause they fly away<br />
  One minute they arrive<br />
  Next you know they're gone<br />
  Fly on<br />
  <br />
  Fly on,<br />
  Ride through<br />
  Maybe one day I'll fly next to you<br />
  Fly on, ride through<br />
  Maybe one day I can fly with you<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Fly on
